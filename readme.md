# LaTeX Bluemark Template
The existing templates for DTU (Danmarks Tekniske Universitet) had an unsatisfactory aesthetic in my opinion. So as my first LaTeX project I decided to try to do better.

This LaTeX template was written with the intention of being used for a bachelor thesis at DTU.
It can, however, easily be adapted to work for normal assignments.
